                <h1>
                    B.Tech
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi offers a four-year B.Tech. Programme in Information
                    Technology &amp; Mathematical Innovations. This unique course, the first one to be offered at
                    Cluster Innovation Centre, is designed to inculcate an innovation mindset as part of the curriculum
                    and pedagogy. Building strong analytical skills through Mathematics and application skills of
                    Information Technology (IT), this course encourages students to recognize the connectedness of
                    various disciplines. Using IT as a vehicle for connecting mathematics with other disciplines,
                    students are encouraged to develop innovative products and processes as part of the curriculum. The
                    course aims to produce adequately skilled graduates with a creative mindset who can provide new
                    solutions to industry in particular and to society in general. It is hoped that some of these
                    innovators will be entrepreneurs, who will be job providers rather than job seekers. The course is
                    specifically designed to boost undergraduate research. <br>

                    The course offers three specialization streams – Management, Electronics &amp; Embedded Systems and
                    Systems Biology – important fields of education with significant interface with Mathematics and IT
                    currently. <br>
                    The mode of learning shall be a healthy and productive blend of the formal and the inquiry-based,
                    with special focus on “hands on” and “project based” mode of learning. Learning shall happen to a
                    large extent through teacher mentoring and peer learning that encourages creativity and relies on
                    innovations. <br>
                    Upon graduation, these students would have acquired innovation-based creativity and would have
                    matured in their thinking. They will have enhanced their communication and leadership abilities, and
                    will have understood the deep and abiding connections between knowledge and its uses - between
                    understanding the needs of society and the relevance of knowledge and the importance of societal
                    obligations. Experiments, hands-on projects, innovative projects, and model implementations linked
                    to the curriculum will be carried out in the “Engineering Kitchen: Innovation Lab”. Assessment, at
                    each stage, is designed in a manner to incentivize innovation by encouraging students to carry out
                    new creative application of the theoretical knowledge acquired, either through a project, or through
                    a laboratory activity/prototype in the engineering kitchen. <br>

                    Meta University Concept <br>

                    The Meta University concept marks a paradigm shift in Higher Education in India. It is based on the
                    premise that the ‘Whole is Greater than the Sum of the Parts’. By drawing upon the established
                    excellence of the partners, the Meta University concept utilizes, exploits and creates synergy
                    between programmes, activities and institutions. It serves as a platform for communication,
                    collaboration and co-operation that optimizes scarce resources as well as free students from the
                    tyranny of boundaries and the constraints of location. Using India’s growing IT tools, the Meta
                    University concept combines the best in traditional systems with the new opportunities for knowledge
                    enhancement. The programme benefits to all stakeholders with its expected outcomes: <br>

                    Objectives of M.Sc. (Mathematics Education) <br>

                    To move away from the conventional pedagogy of teaching mathematics especially at school level and
                    to include methods of facilitating learning such as storytelling, projects, group work and
                    participative learning.
                    To use technology as significant aid in learning.
                    To impart knowledge of some basic concepts and principles of the discipline.
                    To establish inter-disciplinarity between mathematics and other subjects from Humanities and the
                    Social Sciences.
                    To encourage collaborative learning through group activities and hands-on learning.
                    To provide in-service training for schoolteachers.
                    To learn to apply mathematics to real life situations and help in problem solving. <br>
                    Methodology <br>
                    Under the concept of Meta University, M.Sc. (Mathematics Education) is a joint degree two year
                    postgraduate programme jointly offered by University of Delhi and Jamia Millia Islamia. Cluster
                    Innovation Centre (CIC), University of Delhi, administratively manages the program. The program aims
                    to give the students some theoretical inputs and substantial hands-on experience in knowledge
                    making. The Degree course reflects a transdisciplinary approach and promote fresh viewpoints, making
                    the learning and teaching process joyful and productive. Teaching here adopts several platforms
                    including classroom, virtual and project based learning. Interactive methods of instruction are
                    encouraged. Students take combinations of courses at both Jamia Millia Islamia and at the University
                    of Delhi. Hands on learning, integrating school internships and innovation projects are given vital
                    importance. Mentors play key role in-group project work. Mentors are carefully selected for their
                    expertise in the relevant areas. They may be from both within the partner institutions and outside.
